# Game
Well, I tried to make a game for the Black Thorn Productions game jam but ultimately ran out of time

Space = shoot

Arrow Keys = move

*To shoot up you need to be pressing space+up arrow key this also applies for down,left&right if you are not pressing the arrow keys it will shoot in a random direction*

The _*game*_ is here: https://craiky.github.io/Game/
